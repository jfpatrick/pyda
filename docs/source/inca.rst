InCA support
============

InCA is only applicable to the :class:`pyda_japc.JapcProvider` and is not going to be available for other provider
types.

.. note:: InCA API is not completely defined at this point. To use it right now, refer to the directions in
          :ref:`About the PyDA prototype <about_this_prototype:InCA>`.
