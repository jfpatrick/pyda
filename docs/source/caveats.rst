About this prototype
====================

.. note:: TODO: Add all acknowledged shortcomings, future plans and curious details


API Design
----------

* All client APIs have keyword-only arguments. This is done to reduce the likelihood of breaking changes in the
  prototype, should the argument composition change in the future.
